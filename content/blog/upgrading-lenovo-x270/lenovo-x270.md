## Motivations

I appreciate the Thinkpad X series from Lenovo and I am convinced that their products are reliables and comfortable to use.
From the subreddit [r/thinkpad](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/), I learned that some ultrabooks from 2015 were still viable in 2022. 

I’m a Mac user but I use to prefer a PC, and I really like the small form factor of the ultrabooks.
So, I looked on Leboncoin for a used X270 and I bought one for 150€ with the following specs :

**Screen** : TN 1366x768\
**RAM** : 8gb DDR4\
**CPU** : Intel Core i5- 7200U\
**Storage** : M2 SSD 256GB

Honnestly, it’s worth the price. It can run every daily applications or websites without struggles on Windows or Linux (Gentoo), but there is one major issue : the display. TN display does not look great at all comparing to the VA or the IPS today, and the viewing angle is terrible, it’s really difficult to see the screen properly without being exactly placed in front of the display. 

## Upgrading

### Opening the screen’s bezels
### Replacing the screen

It seems scary but actually it’s the easiest part, and it does not even requiert any tool, the bezel of the screen pops off easily. The most difficult part is finding the correct panel.
[This reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/9xl5ud/comment/eabwlw6/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) does explain well how to choose a panel.

Personnaly I bought this IPS panel with FHD from Aliexpress (https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005003361028659.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.5.29535e5b8T5lKT&gatewayAdapt=glo2fra)


### Opening the backplate

### Replacing the wifi card
The Wifi card is kind of good, but since I my wifi router support 6E, I wanted to push this out

### Replacing the SSD M2
### Upgrading the RAM from 8gb to 16gb

## Conclusions

Buying this laptop was a kind of bet actually. I wasn’t expecting this to be *that good* but it really comes handy once upgraded. However, the screen is the only part that needs to be replaced.

The battery is really fine. Obviously, upgrading from a HD to a FHD panel does impact the time on battery, but it’s ok since the main batterie is removable and there is also room for improvement with the internal battery slot.

The only disapointing part is the internal microphone and the speakers. The speaker is muffled, low, and the microphone is aweful, it’s even not usable. But hopefully, it could be replaced by using a headset, so for my part it’s still ok.

I spent more on upgrading pieces than the whole unit (almost 164€). I’m not sure it was really worth comparing to others computers on the market for the same price, but it was definitely fun to play with. 

The form factor comes really handy, so I’m keeping this laptop as my main driver on the go with Gentoo installed.
